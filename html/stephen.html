    Stephen King, born in 1947 in Portland, Maine, is a renowned author
    known for his captivating horror and supernatural fiction. Raised by his
    mother after his parents' separation, King's childhood was spent in
    various locations, including Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford,
    Connecticut.

  <p class="fs-5 text-left">
    He attended the University of Maine at Orono, where he wrote for the
    school newspaper and actively participated in student politics. Despite
    graduating with a degree in English and qualification to teach, health
    issues prevented him from pursuing a teaching career.

    In 1971, he married Tabitha Spruce, and they began their life together
    while King worked odd jobs and continued to write. His breakthrough came
    with the publication of his novel "Carrie" in 1974, followed by numerous
    successful works such as "The Shining" and "The Stand."

    King's success allowed him to focus on writing full-time, and he has
    since become one of the most prolific and successful authors of his
    generation. His contributions to literature have earned him numerous
    awards, including The National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished
    Contribution to American Letters and the National Medal of Arts.
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5 text-left">
    Beyond his literary achievements, King is also known for his
    philanthropy, providing scholarships for local students and supporting
    various charities. He continues to reside in Maine with his wife,
    Tabitha, and their three children.
